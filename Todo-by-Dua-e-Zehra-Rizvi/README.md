# Templates and Styles Sample App

This project is intended to be a simple example of how templates and styles can be used, and is not
expected to be fully functional.

- Design credits: https://dribbble.com/shots/23117193-Todo-App

To run the sample app, either use `just run` command or

```sh
qml -style Styles.Todo.QtQuickControls -I ./qml/ -I ./qml/Templates -I ./qml/Styles -f ./main.qml
```

Created for my [Qt Toronto](https://github.com/Furkanzmc/qt-toronto-2024-templates-styles/) meetup
talk.
